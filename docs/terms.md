# Terms

## What is a payment processor?

A **payment processor** is a financial entity that is appointed by a business to <u>handle credit and debit card transactions.</u> This role is important for the operations of ecommerce businesses that accept card payments, both online and offline.

Payment processors facilitate the transfer of transaction information. However, their role extends beyond just transferring information. Payment processors also provide other services that help to secure, authenticate, and streamline card transactions for businesses.

## What is a payment gateway?
A **payment gateway** is a technology used by businesses to <u>accept card and digital wallet payments from customers.</u> The term includes not only the physical card readers found in brick-and-mortar retail stores but also the online counterparts that take care of the payment process for ecommerce, mobile commerce, and other card-not-present (CNP) transactions.

Payment gateways facilitate communication between the various components involved in the transaction process. They send credit card information from the business’s website to the credit card payment networks for processing, and they return transaction details and responses from the payment networks back to the website.


## What is an acquiring bank?

An **acquiring bank**, also referred to as an “acquirer,” is a bank or financial institution that processes customer credit or debit card payments on behalf of the business and routes them through the card networks to the issuing bank.

Acquiring banks allow businesses to process payments beyond the point of sale (POS) and receive funds from customers. They receive debit and credit card numbers from the business’s payments processor, interface with the credit card networks and customers’ issuing banks to get payments authorized, and then receive the funds.

## What is card authorization?

**Card authorization** is approval from a credit or debit card issuer (usually a bank or credit union) that states the cardholder has sufficient funds or the available credit needed to cover the cost of a transaction they’re using a card to complete.

In one sense, the term “card authorization” can refer to the authorization itself, as in, “We have card authorization for this purchase.” It can also mean the process by which authorization is sought, as in, “We are in the middle of card authorization right now.”

## What is a credit card decline?

**Credit card declines** occur when customers are unable to complete a payment, due to one or more failures in the authorization process. This can happen because of problems with the vendor, payment-processing platform, or credit card issuer.


## What are mobile credit card payments?

**Mobile credit card payments** are payments from a customer to a business in exchange for goods and services that are collected outside of retail environments like brick-and-mortar stores, websites, and apps.

## What are card-not-present (CNP) transactions? 

A **card-not-present (CNP) transaction** is a purchase made remotely, without processing a physical card via a card reader or terminal (and without manually entering a PIN). An increasingly popular purchasing method, CNP transactions grew 23% in 2021, so it’s important that businesses that sell online understand how to accept them securely.


## What does POS stand for?

In the context of payments, **“POS” stands for “point of sale.”** This can refer to two things:

The time and place where a customer makes a purchase from a business. For example, POS might be the checkout counter at a brick-and-mortar retail store, the online checkout flow of an ecommerce website, or the moment when a handyman uses a card reader on his mobile device to process a client’s card in their home.
POS can also refer to the system of hardware and software that, together, facilitate customer purchases for businesses.

## What are digital wallets?

**Digital wallet** technology turns smartphones into payment devices that can initiate financial transactions. Similar to a physical wallet, a digital wallet holds various payment methods—credit cards, debit cards, and bank account numbers—to be used at the point of sale.

Functionality varies depending on the underlying technology. Most digital wallets allow mobile devices to make payments at any point of sale that is enabled for contactless transactions, but some also allow customers to use rewards, spend loyalty points, or store concert and movie tickets, personal identification, boarding passes, and more.

We’ll focus on the payment aspect of digital wallets and what businesses need to know to begin accepting this increasingly common payment method.

## What are payment networks?

**Payment networks** are organizations, such as card associations and electronic-funds-transfer (EFT) networks, that facilitate financial transactions. The term “payment network” refers to any interconnected structure of financial entities—and their respective authorized agents and affiliates—within which funds can be transferred between individuals, businesses, or institutions.

Every payment network operates differently, but they share some basic similarities. Most payment networks are made up of many participating entities, such as credit card companies, banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. These groups of entities are connected by an electronic network through which funds are transferred under the guidance of a shared set of regulations and guidelines. The network itself is maintained and operated by a governing organization, which is often an association made up of participating members.

Every network is designed to solve the same problem: how to move funds between two points as safely, quickly, and cheaply as possible. As we describe the different types of payment networks, you’ll notice that some prioritize one of those three features over the others. Choosing the best payment network for your business requires deciding which of those features is most important to you.
