## What is a payment processor?

A **payment processor** is a financial entity that is appointed by a business to <u>handle credit and debit card transactions.</u> This role is important for the operations of ecommerce businesses that accept card payments, both online and offline.

Payment processors facilitate the transfer of transaction information. However, their role extends beyond just transferring information. Payment processors also provide other services that help to secure, authenticate, and streamline card transactions for businesses.

## What is a payment gateway?
A **payment gateway** is a technology used by businesses to <u>accept card and digital wallet payments from customers.</u> The term includes not only the physical card readers found in brick-and-mortar retail stores but also the online counterparts that take care of the payment process for ecommerce, mobile commerce, and other card-not-present (CNP) transactions.

Payment gateways facilitate communication between the various components involved in the transaction process. They send credit card information from the businessâ€™s website to the credit card payment networks for processing, and they return transaction details and responses from the payment networks back to the website.
