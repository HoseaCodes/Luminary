## Security for Online Payment Platforms Like Stripe

Any FinTech app must ensure an advanced security level, and your payment processing platform is no exception. Take a look at Stripe’s example of exactly how you can make your app secure.

First of all, Stripe encrypts all data and communication on its platform. It uses PGP keys for this.

Furthermore, Stripe’s top level of security is a reality thanks to the platform’s compliance with various regulations.

In particular, it has PCI (Payment Card Industry) Service Provider Level 1 Certification. Stripe uses firewalls, data encryption, two-factor authentication, and other security measures per PCI requirements.

Stripe is also FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) compliant. For customers, this means that if something goes wrong with Stripe, it’s the company, not the customer, that pays the full damages.

One more thing you can consider during online payment platform development is compliance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). This regulation applies within the EU and contains requirements for personal data protection.
