# In-house Stripe-like software development

### Step 1. Discovery and research stage

The first step in building a financial solution like Stripe is to define your requirements. You need to determine what features and functionality you need to include in your online payment platform.

Some of the features you may want to include are payment acceptance, payment management, fraud detection and reporting.

These details form the basis for calculating the project budget. This process includes prototyping and conceptual design with your design team. The exploration phase also helps assess the extent to which the technology, functionality, and overall aesthetics meet the requirements.

### Step 2. Choose the right technology stack

Choosing the right technology stack is crucial to the success of your payment system. You need to select technologies that are reliable, scalable and secure.

Some of the technologies you should consider include:

- Programming languages: Java, Python, Ruby, or PHP
- Frameworks: Spring, Django, Ruby on Rails, or Laravel
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB
- Payment Gateway: Stripe, PayPal, or Braintree

#### Required Tech Stack to Build an Online Payment Processing Platform

Want to learn how to build a payment app like Stripe? Then, it’s worth studying the tech behind it. This platform uses the following tech stack:

- Application and data: Ruby, NSQ, Apache Impala
- Utilities: Google Analytics, Amazon Route, Amazon SES, Mailgun, Mixpanel, Mandrill, Framer
- DevOps: CircleCI, PagerDuty
- Business tools: G Suite, Asana, Zendesk, HackPad, Respondly, Clara Labs, Pagerbot
  
You may use other technologies for coding, but you can take Stripe’s tech stack as a guide.

### Step 3. Build your payment platform

Once you have defined your requirements and chosen your technology stack, it’s time to start building your payment system. You need to develop an architecture that is scalable, secure, and reliable. You also need to implement the features and functionalities that you defined in step one.

### Step 4. Test your financial software

Testing is a critical aspect of building a payment platform. You need to thoroughly test your platform to ensure that it meets your requirements and that it is secure and reliable. You should perform both functional and non-functional testing to identify any issues or bugs.

### Step 5. Launch your FinTech platform

Once you have completed testing and made any necessary changes, it’s time to get your FinTech platform up and running. You need to ensure that your platform complies with all relevant regulations and is capable of processing a high volume of transactions.

Although in-house software development gives you full control over the project and allows for direct communication among team members, it can be a time-consuming and difficult process.

According to a study conducted by DevSkiller, it takes about 40 days to hire an in-house developer, which can extend the development time to several years.
