## Dev Team Size and Salary Rates

Of course, you need workers to create a payment processing platform. The cost and development time will vary depending on your teamâ€™s size and salary rates. 

See which experts must be part of your staff:

- Front-end developer. It is the person who will be responsible for the implementation of the client part of your platform. It is better to involve several developers simultaneously, as we did in our P2P payment web and mobile app Expedipay.
- Back-end developer. This specialist will deal with the implementation of the server part of your platform and work with databases.
- DevOps engineer. Such engineers are responsible for establishing smooth cooperation between development and administration departments.
- QA specialist. This expert will test your platform for any bugs and limitations.
- UI/UX designer. This specialist will implement the general look and feel of your platform.
- Project manager. It is a person who will supervise your team and monitor the timely completion of assigned tasks.
- Business analyst. It is an expert who will help you build an effective business strategy by analyzing the market and your target audience.
