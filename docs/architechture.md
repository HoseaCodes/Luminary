# Stripe Architecture Overview

If the potential challenges associated with building online payment processing like Stripe did not disturb you, then let’s look at the technical side of this platform.

Stripe offers several APIs that customers can easily integrate to start processing payments. In particular, these are the following applied programming interfaces:

- The Payment Intents API. Create integrations to handle complex payment flows with it.
- The Setup Intents API. With it, you can set up a payment method for future payments.
- Payment Methods API. This tool enables you to accept different payment methods.

To create an app like Stripe, you need to use the APIs or SDKs to integrate all the features necessary for your platform.

## Cloud Services Platforms Can Help With an App Infrastructure

As a rule, only large companies can afford to equip their own IT infrastructure. For small businesses or FinTech startups aiming to build a payment app like Stripe, infrastructure is usually something that goes far beyond their budgets.

Fortunately, startups can take advantage of cloud services. Such services are hosted by third-party providers and are available to users via the Internet. Thanks to them, businesses get access to cloud infrastructure, which allows them to reduce costs without harming their system’s performance.

Popular cloud solutions include AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.
